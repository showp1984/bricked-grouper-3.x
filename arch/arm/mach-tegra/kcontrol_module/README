How to use:
Kcontrol will insert this module with the appropriate parameters on it's own if found in /system/lib/modules.
All you need for that to work is compile your kernel with CONFIG_KALLSYMS_ALL.
If you want to test this module on your own without KControl, do this:

echo "0" > /proc/sys/kernel/kptr_restrict
cat /proc/kallsyms | grep core_dvfs_table | tail -n1
XXXXXXXX d core_dvfs_table
cat /proc/kallsyms | grep " soc_speedo_id" | tail -n1
YYYYYYYY b soc_speedo_id

insmod kcontrol_gpu_tegra.ko dvfs_core_table=0xXXXXXXXX soc_speedo_id=0xYYYYYYYY

(If you insert the module without these parameters, the insert will fail and the module will remove itself. No changes will have been done to your kernel.)

The sysfs exposeables are in /sys/kernel/kcontrol_gpu_tegra/.

If you plan on extending this module with any functionality beware of changing the kernel memory.
As that may result in unexpected behavior, like world war III, a black hole, or some other shit.
This module only reads stuff and if it should write something in the future then I am 99.99999% sure that it is safe.
You should be too if your extension plans to modify a running kernel.
Otherwise: Don't touch things of which you have no clue.
